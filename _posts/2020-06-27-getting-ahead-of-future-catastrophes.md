I've been experimenting with various ways of talking about my global risk research. Podcasts were next on my list. ðŸ“»ðŸŽ™

I really enjoyed talking with Keith about the future of civilization, what risks we face, and how we navigate through them! Also I encourage you to check out the art at the beginning and end of the show; it's so on point!
