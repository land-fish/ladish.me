So, who am I and what do I do?

I have a hard time describing this part, because I tend to wear many hats. Here are a few. ðŸŽ© 

## The white hat ðŸ”’

To start with, I have security consulting company, [Gordian Research](https://gordianresearch.org). If youâ€™re a small or medium-sized org and want to tighten up your operational security or better understand the threats you might face, feel free to send me an email.  

## The risk research hat ðŸ“ˆ 

I study global catastrophic risks. My study is grounded in the history of nuclear arms races and risks of nuclear war, but extends to engineered and natural pandemics, AI, and engineered organisms. Iâ€™m interested in both the sociological and technological aspects of global risks.

## The biologist hat ðŸ¦‡

Iâ€™m a biologist, though less a field biologist than I used to be. I mostly stay in the realm of theory, though you will still find me chasing down bats or monkeys on occasion with my binoculars in hand. In the past I studied evolutionary theory and the behavior of the aforementioned organisms. Presently, I am investigating the bioengineering risk landscape.
