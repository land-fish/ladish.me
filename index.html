This image is from the remnants of ancient Rome, as seen in 2019. Human civilizations, like individuals, seem to age and decay over time. Given enough time, species tend to go extinct. There is no reason to think ours is any exception. Except this time, we have far more power to alter our environment. Power to create and power to destroy. I'm looking for a way we can escape this trap, and build something for our descendents that will last.
