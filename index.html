Welcome to my home page. You'll find a collection of my work here: <a href="security">guides</a> to securing your online accounts and personal devices, <a href="posts">write-ups</a>  on risks from emerging technologies, book and article reviews, and some <a href="about">information about me</a>. If you're interested in the motivation for my work, and how I think we got here, read <a href="what-is-anything">this post</a>.
